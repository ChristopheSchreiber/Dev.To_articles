# Introduction
During the various missions I've been sent to, I've worked ona variety of legacy software which suffered from various kind of flaws.

Of course, poor software quality (no unit tests, clean code principles not being used...) was often a major issue, but often there were also problems coming from architectural decisions taken in the early days of the project, or even at the dawn of the enterprise system. This kind of issue are, from my point of view, the greatest cause of pain for many projects.

As a matter of fact, improving code is quite easy, especially now that the software craftsmanship movement is spreading good practices across teams. But changing the core of the systems, the constraints that were imposed at the very beginning of its lifecycle, is very challenging. 

I'll talk about several types of architectural decisions that I've encountered, and that can be real burdens for the teams maintaining these systems.

# Building your system around a business software

# Reusing the framework developed by another team

# Tight coupling between dozens of applications

# Sharing your database with the whole company
